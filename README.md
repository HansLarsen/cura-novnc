# Cura noVNC Docker Container

## Overview

This is a modified version of helfrichmichael's novnc container, this one compiles cura from source, and runs the compiled version.

This is a super basic noVNC build using supervisor to serve Cura in your favorite web browser. This was primarily built for users using the [popular unraid NAS software](https://unraid.net), to allow them to quickly hop in a browser, slice, and upload their favorite 3D prints. 

This is super similar to my [prusaslicer-novnc](https://github.com/helfrichmichael/prusaslicer-novnc) container and basically just adapts that for using Cura via VNC.

## How to use

**In unraid**

If you're using unraid, open your Docker page and under `Template repositories`, add `https://github.com/helfrichmichael/unraid-templates` and save it. You should then be able to Add Container for cura-novnc. For unraid, the template will default to 6080 for the noVNC web instance.

**Outside of unraid**

To run this image, you can run the following command: `docker run --detach --volume=cura-novnc-data:/home/cura/ --volume=cura-novnc-prints:/prints/ -p 8080:8080 --name=cura-novnc cura-novnc`

This will bind `/home/cura/` in the container to a local volume on my machine named `cura-novnc-data`. Additionally it will bind `/prints/` in the container to `cura-novnc-prints` locally on my machine. Finally it will bind port `8080` to `8080`.

## Note for those who installed prior to 02/13/22

This is not required, but a quality of life improvement. If you installed prior to February 13, please consider manually running the following commands to set some helpful environment configurations as it will not set on existing configurations. The commands will do the following:

1. It will set your default Downloads for Firefox to /prints/ for easy slicing.
2. It will add /prints/ as a bookmark in all the file selector views.

To get this, run the following commands:

```
echo "XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR=\"/prints/\"" >> /home/cura/.config/user-dirs.dirs
echo "file:///prints prints" >> /home/cura/.gtk-bookmarks 
```
